                   Diaphragm Breathing


1. Sit comfortably on a chair or lie flat on the floor with your knees raised.



2. Put one palm on your upper chest and the other over your navel. (The objective is to have the lower hand rise first when you breathe).



3. Breathe in slowly through your nose - notice that your stomach moves out. The hand on your chest should remain as still as possible.



4. Breathe out fully and then a little bit more.  You can do this by tightening your stomach muscles and drawing your abdomen inward as you breathe out. Ensure that the hand on your upper chest is still.



5.Pause for 2 seconds.



6. Allow the air to naturally flow in again.



7. Slowly and calmly repeat this cycle a few times and imagine your muscles are relaxing with every exhalation.
