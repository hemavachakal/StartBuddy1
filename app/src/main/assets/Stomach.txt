1. Sit comfortably on a chair.

2. Keep your shoulders & back erect  and rest your hands on your lap and your feet flat on the floor.

3. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Donâ€™t force it, just observe it come in and go out.

4. Now imagine- When you breathe in imagine that your lungs are in your stomach, under your navel.

5. Imagine the feeling of the warm air going all the way down.

6. Follow the path of the breath back up again, from your stomach and out through your nose.

7. Repeat the exercise. Let the air come and go naturally but keep focusing on the thought that your lungs is in the stomach.
