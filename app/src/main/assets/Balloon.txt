            Balloon Breathing
1. Sit comfortably on a chair.


2. Keep your shoulders relaxed, back erect, rest your hands on your lap and  your feet flat on the floor.


3. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Don’t force it, just observe it come in and go out.


4. Now imagine- that instead of lungs, the air you inhale enters a balloon.


5. Pick a color for the balloon- let it be a color that is relaxing and brings a smile on your face.


6. Imagine that each lung has 5 such balloons.


7. Take a deep breath through your nose and imagine the balloons expanding.


8. Breath until you can feel all 5 balloons have expanded.


9. Breathe out and imagine the balloon deflate. Notice how your balloons are empty.


10. Don’t force it. Inhale and exhale comfortably.
